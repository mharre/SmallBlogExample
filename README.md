# SmallBlogExample
Small example of a company blog website with more focus on the backend interaction and little focus on the actual aesthetics of the front end. 
This small company blog website has heavy focus on the backend server interaction with Flask. This includes uses of templates, blueprints, routing, creating blogs,
creating and interaction with a db, uploading profile picture, updating blog posts, registration, login capabilities / security verification with the use of
hashing passwords and comparison, finding posts based on user name, and with the main page displaying all previously created posts.
